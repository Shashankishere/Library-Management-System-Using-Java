Digital Library Management System (Java)
Overview
This project is a simple Digital Library Management System built using Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI). It allows users to manage books in a library, including adding, deleting, viewing, and modifying books. Additionally, users can issue and return books, with the system calculating fines for late returns. The system provides separate interfaces for admins and regular users.

Features
Admin Features:
Add Book: Admins can add new books to the system by specifying the title and author.

Delete Book: Admins can delete a book from the system by entering the book's title.

View Books: Admins can view a list of all books, displaying the title, author, and whether they are issued or available.

Modify Book: Admins can modify the title and author of an existing book.

User Features:
View Books: Users can view a list of available books.

Issue Book: Users can issue a book by specifying the book's title and their name. The system will mark the book as issued.

Return Book: Users can return a book and the system will calculate any fines for late returns.

Technologies Used
Java 8 or later

Swing for GUI components

AWT for event handling and layout management

Simple data structures (ArrayList, List) for storing books and their status

How It Works
Admin has full control over the books in the library. They can add, delete, modify, and view the list of books.

User can interact with the system by issuing and returning books. When returning a book, the system calculates the fine for any overdue days.

Structure of the Code
Classes:
Book:

Represents a book with attributes like title, author, issued status, and issue date.

Includes a method to calculate the fine based on the overdue days.

Admin:

Contains a list of books and methods to add, delete, view, and modify books.

User:

Includes methods for issuing and returning books.

DigitalLibraryManagementGUI:

The main GUI class using Swing. It handles the user interface for both admins and users.

Provides buttons for the admin and user actions, displaying options via dialog boxes.

GUI:
The interface is split into two sections:

Admin Actions: Admin can manage the books.

User Actions: Users can issue and return books.

Example Workflow:
Admin adds books to the system.

User views the available books and issues one by providing their name.

When the user returns the book, the system calculates if there is a fine based on how late the book is returned.
